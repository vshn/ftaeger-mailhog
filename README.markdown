## Overview

This module lets you use Puppet to install and configure MailHog

## Module Description

MailHog is an email testing tool for developers written by Ian Kent (https://github.com/mailhog/). It receives mail and displays it in a WebUI. No login required, no need for user accounts. Just all received mail is shown in the WebUI. 

You can access the WebUI by opening http://$::ipaddress:8025 (default port, feel free to change) in your browser. 

MailHog will receive mail (default is smtp on port 1025) and will display it in the WebUI. You can view and delete the mail. If required one could also forward the mail to the corresponding external Mailserver for the receipients e-mail domain. 

The configuration is straight forward - take a look at the params.pp class for default values.

Due to the size limitation on puppet forge the module will download the mailhog binary to the target system. 

## Setup

### What mailhog affects

* Deploys mailhog binary depending on the architecture the local machine uses (amd64, arm or x86). 
* Creates a "mailhog" user
* Deploys a mailhog.conf file with the available config values
* Installs "daemon" package
* Deploys a initd script to start/stop mailhog as a daemon


### Setup Requirements

This mailhog module requires:
* [puppetlabs-stdlib](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib) 
* [maestrodev-wget](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/maestrodev/wget)


### Beginning with mailhog

The simplest way to get MailHog up and running with the mailhog module is to just add the mailhog-class to your manifest:

```puppet
include mailhog
```

That's it! Really. Didn't hurt, did it? ;-)

You want to change the ip & port MailHog receives incoming mails? No problem:
```puppet
class { 'mailhog':
  smtp_bind_addr_ip   => "1.2.3.4",
  smtp_bind_addr_port => "1125"
}

include mailhog
```
## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here. 

## Reference

### Classes
#### Public Classes
* `mailhog`: Main class, includes all other classes

#### Private Classes
* `mailhog::params`:  Holds default values for MailHog & module config
* `mailhog::install`: Handles deployment of user, dependencies and mailhog binary
* `mailhog::config`:  Handles deployment of mailhog config file
* `mailhog::service`: Handles deployment of the init.d script

#### Download binary
Due to the size limit of packages uploaded to the Forge, the module was designed to offer two options on where to source the MailHog binary from:
* `$download_mailhog = true` (default): The MailHog binary will be downloaded from the official MailHog Github repository. This is good for a few servers as this is very modular and the module can be used right away. 
* `$download_mailhog = false`: The MailHog binary will be sourced from the "files" subdirectory of this module. This is perfect to roll out multiple hosts with this module. In case this feature is required, the admin needs to download the 3 MailHog Linux binaries (MailHog_linux_386, MailHog_linux_arm, MailHog_linux_amd64) to the "files" folder of this module. Just call the mailhog class with `$download_mailhog = false`.

## Limitations

Today the module was tested with Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 only. It might work with other Linux versions though. The more time I have the more I will test. Any help would be really appreciated. 


## Development

Feel free to pull the repository and commit changes. I will review them asap and add them if I think they are helpful or reasonable. No guarantees but a lot of heart ;-)
